## Overview

This project is a clone of Netflix, built using React.js and TMDB API's.

On loading you will get list of netflix originals, different categories of movies, documentaries etc.

On clicking any tile, the respective trailer will be played. I am using movie-trailer npm package for this.
So if the package is able to find the trailer it will be played otherwise nothing happens as of now.

## Planned Updates

I am not planning any updates on this, as I just built this to kind of increase my grip on React Functional Components
